Game: 2D Sidescroller
Video of the prototype is in the repository

Main action of the game:
The player moves around a platform level and the goal is to shoot and defeat the big bee enemy. The score is tied to the number of bullets used, the best score is 50 bullets.

Hardest part to get working in unreal:
It was hard to work out how to get the NPC actor (bee) to move in the direction of the player, and I wasn't able to update the movement in the x and y axis simutaneously instead of one or the other. 
With regard to the slider and toggle, it was hard to find an object reference for any blueprint except the player controller when casting.

Most interesting part of the game:
Due to the mechanics of the bee's movement, this shooting platformer is atypical in that the enemy does not follow the player completely, which makes it challenging to get close enough to shoot without taking damage.
